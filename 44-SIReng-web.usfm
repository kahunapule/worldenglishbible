\id SIR Ecclesiasticus, Revised Version
\h Ecclesiasticus 
\mt2 THE WISDOM OF JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH,
\mt3 OR 
\mt ECCLESIASTICUS. 
\is The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.
\ip WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law and
the prophets, and by the others that have followed in their steps, for the
which things we must give israel the praise of instruction and wisdom; and
since not only the readers must needs become skillful themselves, but also
they that love learning must be able to profit them which are without, both by
speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the
reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books of our fathers, and
having gained great familiarity therein, was drawn on also himself to write
somewhat pertaining to instruction and wisdom; in order that those who love
learning, and are addicted to these things, might make progress much more by
living according to the law. You⌃ are entreated therefore to read with favor
and attention, and to pardon us, if in any parts of what we have laboured to
interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally
spoken in Hebrew have not the same force in them, when they are translated
into another tongue: and not only these, but the law itself, and the
prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are
spoken in their original language. For having come into Egypt in the eight and
thirtieth year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I
found \f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa a like work
\fqa*\ft The word is of very doubtful meaning.
\ft*\f* a copy affording no small instruction. I thought it therefore most
necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to interpret this book;
applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the
book to an end, and set it forth for them also, who in the land of their
sojourning are desirous to learn, fashioning their manners beforehand, so as
to live according to the law.

\v 1 All wisdom \add comes \add* from the Lord,
\q And is with him forever. 
\q
\v 2 The sand of the seas, and the drops of rain,
\q And the days of eternity, who shall number?
\q
\v 3 The height of the heaven, and the breadth of the earth,
\q And the deep, and wisdom, who shall search
\add them \add* out? 
\q
\v 4 Wisdom has been created before all things,
\q And the understanding of prudence from everlasting.
\f + \ft Verses 5 and 7 are omitted by the best authorities

\q
\v 6 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed?
\q And who has known her shrewd counsels?
\f + \ft Verses 5 and 7 are omitted by the best authorities
\ft*\f*
\q
\v 8 There is one wise, greatly to be feared,
\q The Lord sitting upon his throne: 
\q
\v 9 He created her, 
\q And saw, and numbered her, 
\q And poured her out upon all his works.
\q
\v 10 \add She is \add* with all flesh according to his gift;
\q And he gave her freely to them that love him.
\q
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is glory, and exultation,
\q And gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.
\q
\v 12 The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart,
\q And shall give gladness, and joy, and length of days.
\q
\v 13 Whoso fears the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last,
\q And in the day of his death he shall be blessed.
\q
\v 14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
\q And it was created together with the faithful in the womb.
\q
\v 15 With men she \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa nested.
\fqa*\f* laid an eternal foundation; 
\q And with their seed shall she be had in trust.
\q
\v 16 To fear the Lord is the fulness of wisdom;
\q And she satiateth men with her fruits.
\q
\v 17 She shall fill all her house with desirable things,
\q And her garners with her produce. 
\q
\v 18 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom,
\q Making peace and \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa health of cure.
\fqa*\f* perfect health to flourish. \f + \ft The remainder of this verse is
omitted by the best authorities. \ft*\f*
\q
\v 19 He both saw and numbered her; 
\q He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding,
\q And exalted the honor of them that hold her fast.
\q
\v 20 To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom;
\q And her branches are length of days.
\f + \ft Verse 21 is omitted by the best authorities.
\ft*\f*
\b
\q
\v 22 Unjust wrath can never be justified;
\q For the sway of his wrath is his downfall.
\q
\v 23 A man that is longsuffering will \f + \ft Most authorities read
\ft*\fqa resist. \fqa*\f* bear \f + \ft Or,
\ft*\fqa until \fqa*\ft his \ft*\fqa season
\fqa*\f* for a season, 
\q And afterward gladness shall spring up unto him;
\q
\v 24 He will hide his words \f + \ft Or,
\ft*\fqa until \fqa*\ft his \ft*\fqa season
\fqa*\f* for a season, 
\q And the lips of many shall tell forth his understanding.
\q
\v 25 A parable of knowledge is in the treasures of wisdom;
\q But godliness is an abomination to a sinner.
\q
\v 26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments,
\q And the Lord shall give her unto you freely:
\q
\v 27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction;
\q And \add in \add* faith and meekness is his good pleasure.
\q
\v 28 Disobey not the fear of the Lord;\f + \ft The remainder of this line is
omitted by the best authorities. \ft*\f*
\q And come not unto him with a double heart.
\q
\v 29 Be not a hypocrite in the mouths of men;
\q And take good heed to your lips. 
\q
\v 30 Exalt not thyself, lest you fall,
\q And bring dishonor upon your soul; 
\q And \add so \add* the Lord shall reveal your secrets,
\q And shall cast you down in the midst of the congregation;
\q Because you came not unto the fear of the Lord,
\q And your heart was full of deceit. 
\b
\c 2
\q
\v 1 My son, if you come to serve the Lord,
\q Prepare your soul for temptation. 
\q
\v 2 Set your heart aright, and constantly endure,
\q And make not haste in time of calamity.
\q
\v 3 Cleave unto him, and depart not, 
\q That you may be increased at your latter end.
\q
\v 4 Accept whatsoever is brought upon you,
\q And be longsuffering \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa in the changes of your
humiliation. \fqa*\f* when you passest into humiliation.
\q
\v 5 For gold is tried in the fire, 
\q And acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.
\q
\v 6 Put your trust in him, and he will help you:
\q Order your ways aright, and set your hope on him.
\b
\q
\v 7 You⌃ that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy;
\q And turn not aside, lest you⌃ fall. 
\q
\v 8 You⌃ that fear the Lord, put your trust in him;
\q And your reward shall not fail. 
\q
\v 9 You⌃ that fear the Lord, hope for good things,
\q And for eternal gladness and mercy. 
\q
\v 10 Look at the generations of old, and see:
\q Who did ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed?
\q Or who did abide in his fear, and was forsaken?
\q Or who did call upon him, and he despised him?
\q
\v 11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy;
\q And he forgives sins, and saveth in time of affliction.
\b
\q
\v 12 Woe unto fearful hearts, and to faint hands,
\q And to the sinner that goes two ways!
\q
\v 13 Woe unto the faint heart! for it believeth not;
\q Therefore shall it not be defended. 
\q
\v 14 Woe unto you that have lost your patience!
\q And what will you⌃ do when the Lord shall visit you?
\q
\v 15 They that fear the Lord will not disobey his words;
\q And they that love him will keep his ways.
\q
\v 16 They that fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure;
\q And they that love him shall be filled with the law.
\q
\v 17 They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts,
\q And will humble their souls in his sight,
\q
\v 18 \add saying, \add*
\q We will fall into the hands of the Lord,
\q And not into the hands of men: 
\q For as his majesty is, 
\q So also is his mercy. 
\b
\c 3
\q
\v 1 Hear me your father, O my children, q1 And do thereafter, that you⌃ may
be saved. 
\q
\v 2 For the Lord has given the father glory as touching the children,
\q And has confirmed the judgement of the mother as touching the sons.
\q
\v 3 He that honoureth his father shall make atonement for sins:
\q
\v 4 And he that gives glory to his mother is as one that lays up treasure.
\q
\v 5 Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his children;
\q And in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.
\q
\v 6 He that gives glory to his father shall have length of days;
\q And he that hearkeneth unto the Lord shall bring rest unto his mother,
\q
\v 7 \f + \ft The preceding words of this verse are omitted by the best
authorities. \ft*\f* And will do service under his parents, as unto masters.
\q
\v 8 In deed and word honor your father,
\q That a blessing may come upon you from him.
\q
\v 9 For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children;
\q But the curse of the mother rooteth out the foundations.
\b
\q
\v 10 Glorify not thyself in the dishonor of your father;
\q For your father's dishonor is no glory unto you..
\q
\v 11 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father;
\q And a mother in dishonor is a reproach to her children.
\q
\v 12 My son, help your father in his old age;
\q And grieve him not as long as he lives.
\q
\v 13 And if he fail in understanding, have patience with him;
\q And dishonor him not \add while you art
\add* in your full strength. 
\q
\v 14 For the relieving of your father shall not be forgotten:
\q And instead of sins it shall be added to build you up.
\q
\v 15 In the day of your affliction it shall remember you;
\q As fair weather upon ice, 
\q So shall your sins also melt away. 
\q
\v 16 He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer;
\q And he that provoketh his mother is cursed of the Lord.
\b
\q
\v 17 My son, go on with your business in meekness;
\q So shalt you be beloved of an acceptable man.
\q
\v 18 The greater you art, humble thyself the more,
\q And you shalt find favor before the Lord.
\f + \ft Verse 19 is omitted by the best
authorities.\ft*\f*
\q
\v 20 For great is the potency of the Lord,
\q And he is glorified of them that are lowly.
\q
\v 21 Seek not things that are too hard for you,
\q And search not out things that are above your strength.
\q
\v 22 The things that have been commanded you, think thereupon;
\q For you have no need of the things that are secret.
\q
\v 23 Be not over busy in your superfluous works:
\q For more things are showed unto you than men can understand.
\q
\v 24 For the conceit of many has led them astray;
\q And evil surmising has caused their judgement to slip.
\f + \ft Most authorities omit verse 25, and transpose the lines in verse 26.
\ft*\f*
\b
\q
\v 26 A stubborn heart shall fare ill at the last;
\q And he that loves danger shall perish therein.
\q
\v 27 A stubborn heart shall be laden with troubles;
\q And the sinner shall heap sin upon \f + \ft Gr.
\ft*\fqa sins. \fqa*\f* sin. 
\q
\v 28 The calamity of the proud is no healing;
\q For a plant of wickedness has taken root in him.
\q
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable;
\q And the ear of a listener is the desire of a wise man.
\q
\v 30 Water will quench a flaming fire;
\q And almsgiving will make atonement for sins.
\q
\v 31 He that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward;
\q And in the time of his falling he shall find a support.
\b
\c 4
\q
\v 1 My son, deprive not the poor of his living,
\q And make not the needy eyes to wait long.
\q
\v 2 Make not a hungry soul sorrowful; 
\q Neither provoke a man in his distress.
\q
\v 3 To a heart that is provoked add not more trouble;
\q And defer not to give to him that is in need.
\q
\v 4 Reject not a suppliant in his affliction;
\q And turn not away your face from a poor man.
\q
\v 5 Turn not away your eye from one that asketh
\add of you, \add*
\q And give none occasion to a man to curse you:
\q
\v 6 For if he curse you in the bitterness of his soul,
\q He that made him will hear his supplication.
\b
\q
\v 7 Get thyself the love of the congregation;
\q And to a great man bow your head. 
\q
\v 8 Incline your ear to a poor man, 
\q And answer him with peaceable words in meekness.
\q
\v 9 Deliver him that is wronged from the hand of him that wrongeth him;
\q And be not fainthearted in giving judgement.
\q
\v 10 Be as a father unto the fatherless,
\q And instead of a husband unto their mother:
\q So shalt you be as a son of the Most High,
\q And he shall love you more than your mother does.
\b
\q
\v 11 Wisdom exalteth her sons, 
\q And takes hold of them that seek her.
\q
\v 12 He that loves her loves life; 
\q And they that seek to her early shall be filled with gladness.
\q
\v 13 He that holds her fast shall inherit glory;
\q And where \f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa she \fqa*\f* he entereth, the Lord will
bless. 
\q
\v 14 They that do her service shall minister to the Holy One;
\q And them that love her the Lord does love.
\q
\v 15 He that gives ear unto her shall judge the nations;
\q And he that gives heed unto her shall dwell securely.
\q
\v 16 If he trust her, he shall inherit her;
\q And his generations shall have her in possession.
\q
\v 17 For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways,
\q And will bring fear and dread upon him,
\q And torment him with her discipline,
\q Until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgements:
\q
\v 18 Then will she return again the straight way unto him,
\q And will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets.
\q
\v 19 If he go astray, she will forsake him,
\q And give him over \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa to the hands of his fall.
\fqa*\f* to his fall. 
\b
\q
\v 20 Observe the opportunity, and beware of
\f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa an evil man \fqa*\f* evil;
\q And be not ashamed concerning your soul.
\q
\v 21 For there is a shame that brings sin;
\q And there is a shame \add that is \add* glory and grace.
\q
\v 22 Accept not the person \add of any
\add* against your soul; 
\q And \f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa be not abashed
\fqa*\f* reverence no man unto your falling.
\q
\v 23 Refrain not speech, \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa in an occasion of safety.
\fqa*\f* when it tendeth to safety; 
\q \f + \ft Most authorities omit this line.
\ft*\f* And hide not your wisdom for the sake of fair-seeming.
\q
\v 24 For by speech wisdom shall be known;
\q And instruction by the word of the tongue.
\q
\v 25 Speak not against the truth; 
\q And be abashed for your ignorance. 
\q
\v 26 Be not ashamed to make confession of your sins;
\q And force not the current of the river.
\q
\v 27 Lay not thyself down for a fool to tread upon;
\q And accept not the person of one that is mighty.
\q
\v 28 Strive for the truth unto death, and the Lord God shall fight for you.
\b
\q
\v 29 Be not \f + \ft Some authorities read
\ft*\fqa rough. \fqa*\f* hasty in your tongue,
\q And in your deeds slack and remiss. 
\q
\v 30 Be not as a lion in your house, 
\q Nor fanciful among your servants. 
\q
\v 31 Let not your hand be stretched out to receive, and
\f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa drawn back \fqa*\f* closed when you should repay.
\c 5
\q
\v 1 Set not your heart upon your goods;
\q And say not, They are sufficient for me.
\q
\v 2 Follow not your own mind and your strength,
\q To walk in the desires of your heart;
\q
\v 3 And say not, Who shall have dominion over me?
\q For the Lord will surely take vengeance on you.
\b
\q
\v 4 Say not, I sinned, and what happened unto me?
\q For the Lord is longsuffering. \f + \ft The remainder of this verse is
omitted by the best authorities. \ft*\f*
\q
\v 5 Concerning atonement, be not without fear,
\q To add sin upon sins: 
\q
\v 6 And say not, His compassion is great;
\q He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins:
\q For mercy and wrath are with him, 
\q And his indignation will rest upon sinners.
\q
\v 7 Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord;
\q And put not off from day to day: 
\q For suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth;
\f + \ft A line of this verse is here omitted by the best authorities.
\ft*\f*
\q And you shalt perish in the time of vengeance.
\b
\q
\v 8 Set not your heart upon unrighteous gains:
\q For you shalt profit nothing in the day of calamity.
\q
\v 9 Winnow not with every wind, 
\q And walk not in every path: 
\q Thus does the sinner that has a double tongue.
\q
\v 10 Be stedfast in your understanding;
\q And let your word be one. 
\b
\q
\v 11 Be swift to hear; \f + \ft The remainder of this line is omitted by the
best authorities. \ft*\f*
\q And with patience make your answer. 
\q
\v 12 If you have understanding, answer your neighbor;
\q And if not, let your hand be upon your mouth.
\q
\v 13 Glory and dishonor is in talk: 
\q And the tongue of a man is his fall.
\q
\v 14 Be not called a whisperer; 
\q And lie not in wait with your tongue:
\q For upon the thief there is shame, 
\q And an evil condemnation upon him that has a double tongue.
\q
\v 15 In a great matter and in a small, be not ignorant;
\c 6
\q
\v 1 And instead of a friend become not an enemy;
\q For an evil name shall inherit shame and reproach:
\q Even so shall the sinner that has a double tongue.
\b
\q
\v 2 Exalt not thyself in the counsel of your soul;
\q That your soul be not torn in pieces as a bull:
\q
\v 3 You shalt eat up your leaves, and destroy your fruits,
\q And leave thyself as a dry tree. 
\q
\v 4 A wicked soul shall destroy him that has gotten it,
\q And shall make him \f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa a rejoicing
\fqa*\f* a laughingstock to his enemies.
\b
\q
\v 5 \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa A sweet throat.
\fqa*\f* Sweet words will multiply \f + \ft Gr.
\ft*\fqa his. \fqa*\f* a man's friends;
\q And a fair-speaking tongue will multiply courtesies.
\q
\v 6 Let those that are at peace with you be many;
\q But your counsellors one of a thousand.
\q
\v 7 If you would get you a friend, get him
\f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa in the time of trial
\fqa*\f* by proving, 
\q And be not in haste to trust him. 
\q
\v 8 For there is a friend \add that is so
\add* for his own occasion; 
\q And he will not continue in the day of your affliction.
\q
\v 9 And there is a friend that turns to enmity;
\q And he will discover strife to your reproach.
\q
\v 10 And there is a friend that is a companion at the table;
\q And he will not continue in the day of your affliction.
\q
\v 11 And in your prosperity he will be as thyself,
\q And will be bold over your servants:
\q
\v 12 If you shalt be brought low, he will be against you,
\q And will hide himself from your face.
\q
\v 13 Separate thyself from your enemies;
\q And beware of your friends. 
\b
\q
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong \f + \ft Or,
\ft*\fqa covert \fqa*\f* defence; 
\q And he that has found him has found a treasure.
\q
\v 15 There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend;
\q And his excellency is beyond \f + \ft Gr.
\ft*\fqa weight. \fqa*\f* price. 
\q
\v 16 A faithful friend is a medicine of life;
\q And they that fear the Lord shall find him.
\q
\v 17 He that fears the Lord directeth his friendship aright;
\q For as he is, so is his neighbor also.
\b
\q
\v 18 My son, gather instruction from your youth up:
\q And even unto hoar hairs you shalt find wisdom.
\q
\v 19 Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth,
\q And wait for her good fruits; 
\q For your toil shall be little in the tillage of her,
\q And you shalt eat of her fruits right soon.
\q
\v 20 How exceeding harsh is she to the unlearned!
\q And he that is without understanding will not abide in her.
\q
\v 21 As a mighty stone of trial shall she rest upon him;
\q And he will not delay to cast her from him.
\q
\v 22 For wisdom is according to her name; and she is not manifest unto many.
\b
\q
\v 23 Give ear, my son, and accept my judgement,
\q And refuse not my counsel, 
\q
\v 24 And bring your feet into her fetters,
\q And your neck into her chain. 
\q
\v 25 Put your shoulder under her, and bear her,
\q And be not grieved with her bonds. 
\q
\v 26 Come unto her with all your soul,
\q And keep her ways with your whole power.
\q
\v 27 Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto you;
\q And when you have got hold of her, let her not go.
\q
\v 28 For at the last you shalt find her rest;
\q And \f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa it \fqa*\f* she shall be turned for you into
gladness.. 
\q
\v 29 And her fetters shall be to you for a covering of strength,
\q And her chains for a robe of glory. 
\q
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament upon her,
\q And her bands are \f + \ft Num. xv. 38.
\ft*\f* a riband of blue. 
\q
\v 31 You shalt put her on \add as \add* a robe of glory,
\q And shalt array you with her \add as
\add* a crown of rejoicing. 
\b
\q
\v 32 My son, if you wilt, you shalt be instructed;
\q And if you wilt yield your soul, you shalt be
\f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa shrewd \fqa*\f* prudent.
\q
\v 33 If you love to hear, you shalt receive;
\q And if you incline your ear, you shalt be wise.
\q
\v 34 Stand you in the multitude of the elders;
\q And whoso is wise, cleave you unto him.
\q
\v 35 Be willing to listen to every godly discourse;
\q And let not the proverbs of understanding escape you.
\q
\v 36 If you see a man of understanding, get you betimes unto him,
\q And let your foot wear out the steps of his doors.
\q
\v 37 Let your mind dwell upon the ordinances of the Lord,
\q And meditate continually in his commandments:
\q He shall establish your heart, 
\q And your desire of wisdom shall be given unto you.
\b
\c 7
\q
\v 1 Do no evil, so shall no evil overtake you.
\q
\v 2 Depart from wrong, and it shall turn aside from you..
\q
\v 3 My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness,
\q And you shalt not reap them sevenfold.
\b
\q
\v 4 Seek not of the Lord preeminence, 
\q Neither of the king the seat of honor.
\q
\v 5 Justify not thyself in the presence of the Lord;
\q And display not your wisdom before the king.
\q
\v 6 Seek not to be a judge, 
\q Lest you be not able to take away iniquities;
\q Lest haply you fear the person of a mighty man,
\q And lay a stumblingblock in the way of your uprightness.
\b
\q
\v 7 Sin not against the multitude of the city,
\q And cast not thyself down in the crowd.
\q
\v 8 Bind not up sin twice; 
\q For in one \add sin \add* you shalt not be unpunished.
\q
\v 9 Say not, He will look upon the multitude of my gifts,
\q And when I offer to the Most High God, he will accept
\f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa them \fqa*\f* it.
\q
\v 10 Be not fainthearted in your prayer;
\q And neglect not to give alms. 
\b
\q
\v 11 Laugh not a man to scorn when he is in the bitterness of his soul;
\q For there is one who humbles and exalteth.
\q
\v 12 \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa Plow not. \fqa*\f* Devise not a lie against your
brother; 
\q Neither do the like to a friend. 
\q
\v 13 Love not to make any manner of lie;
\q For the custom thereof is not for good.
\q
\v 14 Prate not in the multitude of elders;
\q And repeat not your words in your prayer
\b
\q
\v 15 Hate not laborious work; 
\q Neither husbandry, which the Most High has
\f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa created. \fqa*\f* ordained.
\q
\v 16 Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners:
\q Remember that wrath will not wait. 
\q
\v 17 Humble your soul greatly; 
\q For the punishment of the ungodly man is fire and the worm.
\b
\q
\v 18 Change not a friend for a thing indifferent;

\v 13 The Lord hates every abomination;

\v 14 He himself made man from the beginning,

\q But grace shall be found on the lips of the wise.
\q
\v 17 The mouth of the prudent man shall be sought for in the congregation;
\q And they will ponder his words in their heart.
\b
\q
\v 18 As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool;
\q And the knowledge of an unwise man is
\add as \add*\f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa unexamined words.
\fqa*\f* talk without sense. 
\q
\v 19 Instruction is \add as \add* fetters on the feet of an unwise man,
\q And as manacles on the right hand. 
\q
\v 20 A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter;
\q But a clever man will scarce smile quietly.
\q
\v 21 Instruction is to a prudent man as an ornament of gold,
\q And as a bracelet upon his right arm.
\b
\q
\v 22 The foot of a fool is soon in \add another man's
\add* house; 
\q But a man of experience will be ashamed of entering.
\q
\v 23 A foolish man peepeth in from the door of
\add another man's \add* house; 
\q But a man that is instructed will stand without.
\q
\v 24 It is a want of instruction in a man to listen at the door;
\q But the prudent man will be grieved with the disgrace.
\q
\v 25 \f + \ft The text seems to be uncertain.
\ft*\f* The lips of strangers will be grieved at these things;
\q But the words of prudent men will be weighed in the balance.
\b
\q
\v 26 The heart of fools is in their mouth;
\q But the mouth of wise men is their heart.
\q
\v 27 When the ungodly curseth Satan, 
\q He curseth his own soul. 
\q
\v 28 A whisperer defileth his own soul,
\q And shall be hated wheresoever he sojourneth.

\q
\v 1 A slothful man is compared to a stone that is defiled;
\q And every one will hiss him out in his disgrace.
\q
\v 2 A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill:
\q Every man that takes it up will shake out his hand.
\b
\q
\v 3 A father has shame in having begotten an uninstructed
\add son; \add*
\q And a \add foolish \add* daughter is born to his loss.
\q
\v 4 A prudent daughter shall inherit a husband of her own;
\q And she that brings shame is the grief of him that begat her
\q
\v 5 She that is bold brings shame upon father and husband;
\q And she shall be despised of them both.
\q
\v 6 Unseasonable discourse is \add as \add* music in mourning;
\q But stripes and correction are wisdom at every season.
\b
\q
\v 7 He that teacheth a fool is \add as

\q \add Even as \add* one that waketh a sleeper out of a deep sleep.
\q

\v 11 Weep for the dead, for light has failed
\add him; \add*
\q And weep for a fool, for understanding has failed
\add him: \add*
\q Weep more sweetly for the dead, because he has found rest;
\q But the life of the fool is worse than death.
\q
\v 12 Seven days are \add the days of \add* mourning for the dead;
\q But for a fool and an ungodly man, all the days of his life.
\b
\q
\v 13 Talk not much with a foolish man,
\q And go not to one that has no understanding:
\q Beware of him, lest you have trouble;
\q And \add so \add* you shalt not be \f + \ft Or,
\ft*\fqa defiled: in his onslaught turn
\fqa*\f* defiled in his onslaught:

\q
\v 14 What shall be heavier than lead? 
\q And what is the name thereof, but a fool?
\q
\v 15 Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear,
\q Than a man without understanding. 
\b
\q
\v 16 Timber girt and bound into a building shall not be loosed with shaking:
\q So a heart established in due season on well advised counsel shall not be
afraid. 
\q
\v 17 A heart settled upon a thoughtful understanding
\q Is as an ornament of plaister on a polished wall.
\q
\v 18 Pales set on a high place will not stand against the wind:
\q So a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool will not stand against any
fear. 
\b
\q
\v 19 He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall;
\q And he that pricketh the heart makes it to show feeling.
\q
\v 20 Whoso casteth a stone at birds frayeth them away;
\q And he that upbraids a friend will dissolve friendship.
\q
\v 21 If you have drawn a sword against a friend, despair not;
\q For there may be a returning. 
\q
\v 22 If you have opened your mouth against a friend, fear not;
\q For there may be a reconciling; 
\q Except it be for upbraiding, and arrogance, and disclosing of a secret, and
a treacherous blow: 
\q For these things every friend will flee.
\b
\q
\v 23 Gain trust with your neighbor in his poverty,

\q
\v 25 I will not be ashamed to shelter a friend;

\q
\v 26 And if any evil happen unto me because of him,
\q Every one that hears it will beware of him.
\b
\q
\v 27 Who shall set a watch over my mouth,

\c 23
\q
\v 1 O Lord, Father and Master of my life,
\q Abandon me not to their counsel: 
\q Suffer me not to fall by them. 
\q
\v 2 Who will set scourges over my thought,
\q And a discipline of wisdom over mine heart?
\q That they spare me not for mine ignorances,
\q And \add my heart \add* pass not by their sins:
\q
\v 3 That mine ignorances be not multiplied,

\v 7 Hear you⌃, my children, the discipline of the mouth;
\q And he that keepeth it shall not be taken.
\q
\v 8 The sinner shall be \f + \ft Most authorities read

\q And the reviler and the proud man shall stumble therein.
\q
\v 9 Accustom not your mouth to an oath;
\q And be not accustomed to the naming of the Holy One.
\q
\v 10 For as a servant that is continually scourged shall not lack a bruise,
\q So he also that sweareth and names \add God
\add* continually shall not be cleansed from sin.
\q
\v 11 A man of many oaths shall be filled with iniquity;
\q And the scourge shall not depart from his house:
\q If he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him;
\q And if he disregard it, he has sinned doubly;
\q And if he has sworn in vain, he shall not be justified;
\q For his house shall be filled with calamities.
\q
\v 12 There is a manner of speech that is clothed about with death:
\q Let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob;
\q For all these things shall be far from the godly,
\q And they shall not wallow in sins. 
\q
\v 13 Accustom not your mouth to gross rudeness,
\q For therein is the word of sin. 
\q
\v 14 Remember your father and your mother,
\q For you sittest in the midst of great men;
\q That you be not forgetful before them,
\q And become a fool by your custom, 
\q So shalt you wish that you had not been born,
\q And curse the day of your nativity. 
\q
\v 15 A man that is accustomed to words of reproach
\q Will not be corrected all the days of his life.
\b
\q
\v 16 Two sorts \add of men \add* multiply sins,
\q And the third will bring wrath: 
\q A hot mind, as a burning fire, will not be quenched till it be consumed:
\q A fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease till he has

\fqa*\f* burned out the fire. 
\q
\v 17 All bread is sweet to a fornicator:

\q
\v 18 A man that goes astray from his own bed,
\q Saying in his heart, Who sees me? 
\q Darkness is round about me, and the walls hide me,
\q And no man sees me; of whom am I afraid?
\q The Most High will not remember my sins;
\q
\v 19 — And the eyes of men are his terror,
\q And he knows not that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter
than the sun, 
\q Beholding all the ways of men, 
\q And looking into secret places. 
\q
\v 20 All things were known unto him or ever they were created;
\q And in like manner also after they were perfected.
\q
\v 21 This man shall be punished in the streets of the city;
\q And where he suspected not he shall be taken.
\q
\v 22 So also a wife that leaves her husband,
\q And brings in an heir by a stranger.
\q
\v 23 For first, she was disobedient in the law of the Most High;
\q And secondly, she trespassed against her own husband;
\q And thirdly, she played the adulteress in whoredom,
\q And brought in children by a stranger.
\q
\v 24 She shall be brought out into the congregation;
\q And upon her children shall there be visitation.
\q
\v 25 Her children shall not spread into roots,
\q And her branches shall bear no fruit.
\q
\v 26 She shall leave her memory for a curse;
\q And her reproach shall not be blotted out.
\q
\v 27 And they that are left behind shall know that there is nothing better

\q
\v 3 I came forth from the mouth of the Most High,
\q And covered the earth as a mist. 
\q
\v 4 I lived in high places, 
\q And my throne is in the pillar of the cloud.
\q
\v 5 Alone I compassed the circuit of heaven,
\q And I walked in the depth of the abyss.
\q
\v 6 In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth,
\q And in every people and nation, I got a possession.
\q
\v 7 With all these I sought rest; 
\q And in whose inheritance shall I lodge?
\q
\v 8 Then the Creator of all things gave me a commandment;
\q And he that created me made my tabernacle to rest,
\q And said, Let your tabernacle be in Jacob,
\q And your inheritance in Israel. 
\q
\v 9 He created me from the beginning before the world;
\q And to the end I shall not fail. 
\q
\v 10 In the holy tabernacle I ministered before him;
\q And so was I established in Sion. 
\q
\v 11 In the beloved city likewise he gave me rest;
\q And in Jerusalem was my authority. 
\q
\v 12 And I took root in a people that was glorified,
\q Even in the portion of the Lord's own inheritance.
\q
\v 13 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus,
\q And as a cypress tree on the mountains of Hermon.
\q
\v 14 I was exalted like a palm tree on the sea shore,
\q And as rose plants in Jericho, 
\q And as a fair olive tree in the plain;
\q And I was exalted as a plane tree. 
\q
\v 15 As cinnamon and aspalathus, I have given a scent of perfumes;
\q And as choice myrrh, I spread abroad a pleasant odour;

\q And as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.
\q
\v 16 As the terebinth I stretched out my branches;

\v 28 The first man knew her not perfectly;

\q
\v 2 But three sorts \add of men \add* my soul hates,
\q And I am greatly offended at their life:
\q A poor man that is haughty, and a rich man that is a liar,

\b
\q
\v 3 In \add your \add* youth you have not gathered,

\v 4 How beautiful a thing is judgement for gray hairs,

\v 7 There be nine things that I have thought of, and in mine heart counted
happy; 
\q And the tenth I will utter with my tongue:
\q A man that has joy of his children; 
\q A man that lives and looks upon the fall of his enemies:
\q
\v 8 Happy is he that dwells with a wife of understanding;
\q And he that has not slipped with his tongue;
\q And he that has not served a man that is unworthy of him:
\q
\v 9 Happy is he that has found prudence;
\q And he that discourseth in the ears of them that listen.
\q
\v 10 How great is he that has found wisdom!

\v 15 There is no head above the head of a serpent;

\q
\v 16 I will rather dwell with a lion and a dragon,

\q
\v 17 The wickedness of a woman changeth her look,

\q
\v 18 Her husband shall sit at meat among his neighbors,

\q
\v 22 There is anger, and impudence, and great reproach,

\q
\v 23 A wicked woman is abasement of heart,

\v 6 A grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous of

\q The Lord shall prepare him for the sword.
\b
\q
\v 29 A merchant shall hardly keep himself from wrong doing;

\c 27
\q
\v 1 Many have sinned for a thing indifferent;

\v 8 If you followest righteousness, you shalt obtain her,

\v 11 The discourse of a godly man is always wisdom:

\q
\v 13 The discourse of fools is an offence;

\q
\v 14 The talk of a man of many oaths will make the hair stand upright;
\q And their strife makes one stop his ears.
\q
\v 15 The strife of the proud is a shedding of blood;
\q And their reviling of each other is a grievous thing to hear.
\b
\q
\v 16 He that revealeth secrets destroys credit,
\q And shall not find a friend to his mind.
\q
\v 17 Love a friend, and keep faith with him:
\q But if you reveal his secrets, 
\q You shalt not pursue after him; 
\q
\v 18 For as a man has destroyed his enemy,
\q So have you destroyed the friendship of your neighbor.
\q
\v 19 And as a bird which you have loosed out of your hand,
\q So have you let your neighbor go, and you wilt not catch him again:
\q
\v 20 Pursue him not, for he is gone far away,
\q And has escaped as a gazelle out of the snare.
\q
\v 21 For a wound may be bound up, and after reviling there may be a

\b
\q
\v 30 Wrath and anger, these also are abominations;
\q And a sinful man shall possess them.
\c 28
\q
\v 1 He that takes vengeance shall find vengeance from the Lord;
\q
\q And he will surely make firm his sins.
\q
\v 2 Forgive your neighbor the hurt that he has done
\add you; \add*
\q And then your sins shall be pardoned when you prayest.
\q
\v 3 Man cherisheth anger against man; 
\q
\q And does he seek healing from the Lord?
\q
\v 4 Upon a man like himself he has no mercy;
\q And does he make supplication for his own sins?
\q
\v 5 He being himself flesh nourisheth wrath:
\q Who shall make atonement for his sins?
\q
\v 6 Remember your last end, and cease from enmity:
\q \add Remember \add* corruption and death, and abide in the commandments.
\q
\v 7 Remember the commandments, and be not angry with your neighbor;
\q And \add remember \add* the covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance.
\b
\q
\v 8 Abstain from strife, and you shalt diminish your sins:
\q For a passionate man will kindle strife;
\q
\v 9 And a man that is a sinner will trouble friends,
\q And will make debate among them that be at peace.
\q
\v 10 \f + \ft The order of the lines in this verse is uncertain.
\ft*\f* As is the fuel of the fire, so will it burn;
\q And as the stoutness of the strife is,
\add so \add* will it burn: 
\q As is the strength of the man, \add so
\add* will be his wrath; 
\q And as is his wealth, \add so \add* will he exalt his anger.
\q
\v 11 A contention begun in haste kindleth a fire;
\q And a hasty fighting sheddeth blood.
\q
\v 12 If you blow a spark, it shall burn;
\q And if you spit upon it, it shall be quenched:
\q And both these shall come out of your mouth.
\b
\q
\v 13 Curse the whisperer and double-tongued:
\q For he has destroyed many that were at peace.
\q
\v 14 A third person's tongue has shaken many,
\q And dispersed them from nation to nation;
\q And it has pulled down strong cities,
\q And overthrown the houses of great men.
\q
\v 15 A third person's tongue has cast out brave women,
\q And deprived them of their labours. 
\q
\v 16 He that hearkeneth unto it shall not find rest,
\q Nor shall he dwell quietly. 
\q
\v 17 The stroke of a whip makes a mark in the flesh;
\q But the stroke of a tongue will break bones.
\q
\v 18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword:
\q Yet not so many as they that have fallen because of the tongue.
\q
\v 19 Happy is he that is sheltered from it,
\q That has not passed through the wrath thereof;
\q That has not drawn its yoke, 
\q And has not been bound with its bands.
\q
\v 20 For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron,
\q And the bands thereof are bands of brass.
\q
\v 21 The death thereof is an evil death;
\q And Hades were better than it. 
\q
\v 22 It shall not have rule over godly men;
\q And they shall not be burned in its flame.
\q
\v 23 They that forsake the Lord shall fall into it;
\q And it shall burn among them, and shall not be quenched:
\q It shall be sent forth upon them as a lion;
\q And as a leopard it shall destroy them.
\q
\v 24 Look that you hedge your possession about with thorns;
\q Bind up your silver and your gold; 
\q
\v 25 And make a balance and a weight for your words;
\q And make a door and a bar for your mouth.
\q
\v 26 Take heed lest you slip therein; 
\q Lest you fall before one that lies in wait.
\b
\c 29
\q
\v 1 He that shows mercy will lend unto his neighbor;
\q And he that strengtheneth him with his hand keepeth the commandments.
\q
\v 2 Lend to your neighbor in time of his need;
\q And pay you your neighbor again in due season.
\q
\v 3 Confirm your word, and keep faith with him;
\q And at all seasons you shalt find what you needest.
\q
\v 4 Many have reckoned a loan as a windfall,
\q And have given trouble to those that helped them.
\q
\v 5 Till he has received, he will kiss a man's hands;
\q And for his neighbor's money he will speak submissly:
\q And when payment is due, he will prolong the time,
\q And return words of heaviness, and complain of
\f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa the season. \fqa*\f* the times.
\q
\v 6 If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half;
\q And he will count it as a windfall: 
\q If not, he has deprived him of his money,
\q And he has gotten him for an enemy without cause:
\q He will pay him with cursings and railings;
\q And for honor he will pay him disgrace.
\q
\v 7 \f + \ft Some ancient authorities read
\ft*\fqa Many therefore. \fqa*\f* Many on account of
\add men's \add* ill-dealing have turned away;
\q They have feared to be defrauded for nought.
\q
\v 8 Howbeit with a man in poor estate be longsuffering;
\q And let him not wait for \add your \add* alms.
\q
\v 9 Help a poor man for the commandment's sake;
\q And according to his need send him not empty away.
\q
\v 10 Lose \add your \add* money for a brother and a friend;
\q And let it not rust under the stone to be lost.
\q
\v 11 Bestow your treasure according to the commandments of the Most High;
\q And it shall profit you more than gold.
\q
\v 12 Shut up alms in your store-chambers;
\q And it shall deliver you out of all affliction:
\q
\v 13 It shall fight for you against your enemy
\q Better than a mighty shield and a ponderous spear.
\b
\q
\v 14 A good man will be surety for his neighbor;
\q And he that has lost shame will fail him.
\q
\v 15 Forget not the good offices of your surety;
\q For he has given his life for you. 
\q
\v 16 A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety;
\q
\v 17 And he that is of an unthankful mind will fail him that delivered him.
\q
\v 18 Suretiship has undone many that were prospering,
\q And shaken them as a wave of the sea:
\q Mighty men has it driven from their homes;
\q And they wandered among strange nations.
\q
\v 19 A sinner that falls into suretiship,
\q And undertaketh contracts for work, shall fall into lawsuits.
\q
\v 20 Help your neighbor according to your power,
\q And take heed to thyself that you fall not
\add to the same. \add*
\b
\q
\v 21 The chief thing for life is water, and bread,
\q And a garment, and a house to cover shame.
\q
\v 22 Better is the life of a poor man under a shelter of logs,
\q Than sumptuous fare in another man's house.
\q
\v 23 With little or with much, be well satisfied.
\f + \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities.

\q
\v 24 It is a miserable life to go from house to house:
\q And where you art a sojourner, you shalt not
\add dare to \add* open your mouth. 
\q
\v 25 You shalt entertain, and give to drink, and have no thanks:
\q And besides this you shalt hear bitter words.
\q
\v 26 Come hither, you sojourner, furnish a table,
\q And if you have aught in your hand, feed me with it.
\q
\v 27 Go forth, you sojourner, from the face of honor;
\q My brother is come to be my guest; I have need of my house.
\q
\v 28 These things are grievous to a man of understanding;
\q The upbraiding of house-room, and the reproaching of the money-lender.
\b
\c 30
\q
\v 1 He that loves his son will continue to lay stripes upon him,
\q That he may have joy of him in the end.
\q
\v 2 He that chastiseth his son shall have profit of him,
\q And shall glory of him among his acquaintance.
\q
\v 3 He that teacheth his son shall provoke his enemy to jealousy;
\q And before friends he shall rejoice of him.
\q
\v 4 His father dieth, and is as though he had not died;
\q For he has left one behind him like himself.
\q
\v 5 In his life, he saw and rejoiced \add in him;
\add*
\q And when he died, he sorrowed not: 
\q
\v 6 He left behind him an avenger against his enemies,
\q And one to requite kindness to his friends.
\q
\v 7 He that makes too much of his son shall bind up his wounds;
\q And his heart will be troubled at every cry.
\q
\v 8 An unbroken horse becometh stubborn;
\q And a son left at large becometh headstrong.
\q
\v 9 Cocker your child, and he shall make you afraid:
\q Play with him, and he will grieve you.
\q
\v 10 Laugh not with him, lest you have sorrow with him;
\q And you shalt gnash your teeth in the end.
\q
\v 11 Give him no liberty in his youth,
\q \f + \ft These three lines are absent from the oldest MSS.
\ft*\f* And wink not at his follies. 
\q
\v 12 \f + \ft These three lines are absent from the oldest MSS.
\ft*\f* Bow down his neck in his youth,
\q And beat him on the sides while he is a child,
\q Lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto you;
\q \f + \ft These three lines are absent from the oldest MSS.
\ft*\f* And there shall be sorrow to your soul.
\q
\v 13 Chastise your son, and take pains with him,
\q Lest his shameless behavior be an offence unto you.
\b
\q
\v 14 Better is a poor man, being sound and strong of constitution,
\q Than a rich man that is plagued in his body.
\q
\v 15 Health and a good constitution are better than all gold;
\q And a strong body than wealth without measure.
\q
\v 16 There is no riches better than health of body;
\q And there is no gladness above the joy of the heart.
\q
\v 17 Death is better than a bitter life,
\q \f + \ft The oldest MSS. omit \ft*\fqa And eternal rest.
\fqa*\f* And \f + \ft Gr. \ft*\fqa age-long rest.
\fqa*\f* eternal rest than a continual sickness.
\q
\v 18 Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed
\q Are \add as \add* messes of meat laid upon a grave.
\q
\v 19 What does an offering profit an idol?
\q For neither shall it eat nor smell: 
\q So is he that is afflicted of the Lord,
\q
\v 20 Seeing with his eyes and groaning,
\q As an eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning.
\b
\q
\v 21 Give not over your soul to sorrow;
\q And afflict not thyself in your own counsel.
\q
\v 22 Gladness of heart is the life of a man;
\q And the joyfulness of a man is length of days.
\q
\v 23 Love your own soul, and comfort your heart:
\q And remove sorrow far from you; 
\q For sorrow has destroyed many, 
\q And there is no profit therein. 
\q
\v 24 Envy and wrath shorten \add a man's
\add* days; 
\q And care brings old age before the time.
\q
\v 25 A cheerful and good heart 
\q Will have a care of his meat and diet.
\c 31
\q
\v 1 Wakefulness that comes of riches consumeth the flesh,
\q And the anxiety thereof puts away sleep.
\q
\v 2 Wakeful anxiety will crave slumber;
\q And \f + \ft This appears to be the meaning; but the Greek text here is
probably corrupt. \ft*\f* in a sore disease sleep will be broken.
\b
\q
\v 3 A rich man toileth in gathering money together;
\q And when he rests, he is filled with his good things.
\q
\v 4 A poor man toileth in lack of substance;
\q And when he rests, he becometh needy.
\q
\v 5 He that loves gold shall not be justified;
\q And he that follows destruction shall himself have his fill
\add of it. \add*
\q
\v 6 Many have been given over to ruin for the sake of gold;
\q And their perdition \f + \ft Or, \ft*\fqa comes to pass in their faces
\fqa*\f* meeteth them face to face. 
\q
\v 7 It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it;
\q And every fool shall be taken therewith.
\q
\v 8 Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish,
\q And that goes not after gold. 
\q
\v 9 Who is he? and we will call him blessed:
\q For wonderful things has he done among his people.
\q
\v 10 Who has been tried thereby, and found perfect?
\q Then let him glory. 
\q Who has had the power to transgress, and has not transgressed?
\q And to do evil, and has not done it?
\q
\v 11 His goods shall be made sure, 
\q And the congregation shall declare his alms.
\q
\v 12 Sittest you at a great table? \f + \ft Gr.
\ft*\fqa open not your throat upon it.\fqa*\f* be not greedy upon it,
\q And say not, Many are the things upon it.
\q
\v 13 Remember that an evil eye is a wicked thing:
\q What has been created more evil than an eye?
\q Therefore it sheddeth tears from every face.
\q
\v 14 Stretch not your hand whithersoever it looks,
\q And thrust not thyself with it into the dish.
\q
\v 15 Consider your neighbor's \add liking
\add* by your own; 
\q And be discreet in every point. 
\q
\v 16 Eat, as \add becometh \add* a man, those things which are set before
you; 
\q And eat not greedily, lest you be hated.
\q
\v 17 Be first to leave off for manners' sake;
\q And be not insatiable, lest you offend.
\q
\v 18 And if you sittest among many, 
\q Reach not out your hand before them.
\b
\q
\v 19 How sufficient to a well-mannered man is a very little,
\q And he does not breathe hard upon his bed.
\q
\v 20 Healthy sleep comes of moderate eating;
\q He riseth early, and his wits are with him:
\q The pain of wakefulness, and colic, 
\q And griping, are with an insatiable man.
\q
\v 21 And if you have been forced to eat,
\q Rise up in the midst thereof, and you shalt have rest.
\q
\v 22 Hear me, my son, and despise me not,
\q And at the last you shalt find my words
\add true: \add*
\q In all your works be quick, 
\q And no disease shall come unto you. 
\b
\q
\v 23 Him that is liberal of his meat the lips shall bless;
\q And the testimony of his excellence shall be believed.
\q
\v 24 Him that is a niggard of his meat the city shall murmur at;
\q And the testimony of his niggardness shall be sure.
\b
\q
\v 25 Show not thyself valiant in wine;
\q For wine has destroyed many. 
\q
\v 26 The furnace proveth the temper \add of steel
\add* by dipping; 
\q So does wine \add prove \add* hearts in the quarreling of the proud.
\q
\v 27 Wine is as good as life to men, 
\q If you drink it in its measure: 
\q What life is there to a man that is without wine?
\q And it has been created to make men glad.
\q
\v 28 Wine drunk in season \add and \add* to satisfy
\q Is joy of heart, and gladness of soul:
\q
\v 29 Wine drunk largely is bitterness of soul,
\q With provocation and conflict. 
\q
\v 30 Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool unto his hurt;
\q It diminisheth strength, and addeth wounds.
\b
\q
\v 31 Rebuke not your neighbor at a banquet of wine,
\q Neither set him at nought in his mirth:
\q Speak not unto him a word of reproach,
\q And press not upon him by asking back
\add a debt. \add*
